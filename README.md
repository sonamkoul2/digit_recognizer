# digit_recognizer
## You will learn to:
- build a basic linear regression model with tensorflow
- Learn about the MNIST data and softmax regressions
- Create a function that is a model for recognizing digits, based on looking at every pixel in the image
- Use TensorFlow to train the model to recognize digits by having it "look" at thousands of examples (and run our first TensorFlow session to do so)
- Check the model's accuracy with our test data
